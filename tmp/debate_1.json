They can process vast amounts of data quickly, ensuring that all relevant information is considered. AI judges would apply the law uniformly across similar cases, addressing the issue of sentencing disparities that plague our current system."

Judges must weigh complex ethical considerations, show compassion, and understand unspoken cultural contexts. While AI may appear unbiased, it inherits biases from its training data and lacks the critical human ability to recognize when established precedent should be challenged for moral progress in society."
